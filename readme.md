TO IMPLEMENT :-

-> Implement p2p functionality, User will have the file on their machine and will only share the filename and path,
...When another user requests for file, websockets will be created to help i transfer ofthe file.
...User can also upload their files to the server, But those files will occupy space and my computer doesn't have enough .....space. Although downloader will not have to rely on the uploader as the file now resides on the server.

-> Create all the pages i.e. about, contact, donate.

-> Style all the pages, Try using minimalistic styles.

-> Check for any error.
